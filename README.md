This will be a professional site for my wife Nazgol Bagheri, an Associate Professor at UTSA. It'll be a pretty simple
site, probably a one-pager, though I'll need a CMS so that she can make updates without needing to edit code. The
current plan is to use Eleventy (static site generation) + Netlify CMS. I'm going with Eleventy over some others like
Next.js and Gatsby because since this is going to be a small, static site, I won't need React.
